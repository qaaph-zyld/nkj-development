title: "From Blind to Real-Time: Production Visibility for a Mid-Size Automotive Supplier"
client: "Mid-Size Brake Component Manufacturer"
industry: "Automotive Tier 2"
challenge: "Plant management relied on 24-hour delayed reports, making it impossible to identify and correct line downtime or quality issues during the active shift."
solution: "A custom SQL-based data extraction pipeline feeding a Python ETL layer, visualized in real-time on a web dashboard directly on the shop floor."
results: [
  "OEE improved from 62% to 78% within 3 months",
  "Unplanned downtime reduced by 35%",
  "Daily production meetings shortened by 45 minutes"

## The Challenge

A 200-employee Tier 2 automotive supplier manufacturing brake components was struggling with a classic manufacturing problem: they were driving their operation looking exclusively in the rearview mirror.

The plant ran a legacy instance of QAD ERP. While the system accurately tracked inventory and financials, production data entry was a manual process. Operators would write downtime codes and scrap counts on paper logs, which were then keyed into the ERP by a supervisor at the end of the shift.

The next morning, the Plant Manager would review an Excel report detailing yesterday's performance. By the time they discovered that Line B had suffered four hours of micro-stops due to a faulty sensor, the damage was already done. The shift was lost, and production was behind schedule.

They needed real-time visibility, but quotes for "Enterprise Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)" were starting at €250,000—a budget impossible to justify for a plant of their size.

## The NKJ Development Approach

We proposed a lightweight, high-impact solution leveraging the data they already had, bypassing the need for a massive software deployment.

### Step 1: Automated Data Extraction

We wrote optimized SQL queries that polled the underlying Progress database of their QAD ERP. Instead of waiting for manual end-of-shift entries, we tied into the live machine state tables and material issue transactions.

### Step 2: Python ETL Layer

A lightweight Python script running on a local server aggregated this raw data every 60 seconds. It applied the plant's specific business logic to calculate:
- Live OEE (Availability, Performance, Quality)
- Current cycle time vs. Ideal cycle time
- Scrap rate by defect type

### Step 3: Real-Time Visualization

We built a custom React dashboard—similar to the [Advanced Dashboard Preview](/dashboard)—and deployed it on inexpensive large-screen monitors above the production lines. 

The dashboard was color-coded: green for on-target, yellow for warning, red for critical.

## The Results

The impact of making data visible to the people doing the work was immediate.

When a line went into the "red" due to micro-stops, operators no longer waited for a supervisor; they called maintenance immediately because the scoreboard was visible to everyone. Maintenance response times dropped dramatically.

Within three months of deploying the live dashboards:
- **OEE improved from a baseline of 62% to 78%**, driven almost entirely by a reduction in undocumented micro-stops.
- **Unplanned downtime decreased by 35%**, as chronic machine issues were highlighted and fixed rather than hidden in daily averages.
- The morning production meeting, which previously involved 45 minutes of debating whose data was correct, became a **15-minute focused discussion** on root cause analysis.

You don't need a €250,000 software suite to transform your factory floor. You just need your existing data, extracted intelligently, and visualized clearly.
